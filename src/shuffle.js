 * Returns the original array after mutation.
 * Shuffle function uses the Fisher-Yates Shuffle Modern algorithm to take an array and randomly shuffle its data.
 * The algorithm starts with the final index, generates a random index, then swaps the data at the final index with the random one.
 * It continues to do this, working its way from final index to first index where it ends.
 *
 * @param {array} arr - The input data array.
 * @returns {array} - Mutated input data array.
